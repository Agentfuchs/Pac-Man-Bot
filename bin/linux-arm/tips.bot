• Each eaten ghost during the same power mode yields twice as many points as the last!
• Eat the fruit that spawns after eating a large amount of pellets for etxra points!
• Just after starting and 3 more times after, the ghosts scatter instead of chasing the player, for a short rest.
• The ghosts can't turn 180º unless they're **E**atable or have just switched between chasing and scattering.
• Blinky chases you, Pinky tries to ambush you, Inky will come to Blinky's aid, and Clyde is kind of scared of you.
• Ghosts will not go up from below the T-intersections located right above the ghost cage and starting area.
