Play Pac-Man in a Discord chat! Works in a server with friends or in direct messages with the bot. Featuring turn-based gameplay with reaction controls, the focus is low spam and original arcade game fidelity. Get a spot on the global leaderboard!

If Pac-Man isn't your thing, there are several other minigames:
* Pets: Enjoy your own simple tamagotchi clone.
* Uno: Play with up to 10 friends and bots.
* Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four: Challenge your friends or the bot itself!

You can host this bot yourself. You may find the run-ready linux release in `bin/Release/netcoreapp-2.0/linux-x64/publish/`  
The `config.bot` and `contents.bot` files in `bin/` are necessary for the bot to run.
