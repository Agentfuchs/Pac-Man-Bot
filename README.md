Play Pac-Man in a Discord chat! Works in a server with friends or in direct messages with the bot. Featuring turn-based gameplay with reaction controls, the focus is low spam and original arcade game fidelity. Get a spot on the global leaderboard!

If Pac-Man isn't your thing, there are several other minigames:
* Pets: Enjoy your own simple tamagotchi clone.
* Uno: Play with up to 10 friends and bots.
* Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four: Challenge your friends or the bot itself!

You can compile this bot yourself using an IDE such as Visual Studio or Resharper, or using the Publish.bat batch file. You will need to include the NuGet Source for the Discord.Net beta, [link here](https://www.myget.org/F/discord-net/api/v3/index.json).  
If you would like to run and host this bot yourself, and would like to be able to use the bot's custom emotes (found in Constants.cs), please send me a message.  
The `config.bot` and `contents.bot` files in `bin/` are necessary for the bot to run.  
There is also the linux release branch, which always has the latest version.
